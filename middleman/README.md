Middleman + Bower + processing.js:

tried setting up rollageStudy1 into web project
to see if the sketch works in the browser, via processing.js

sketch running in browser,
but image is not loading, not sure how to debug

realized entire page would be a canvas element anyway,
and not what I want anyway.

dead end.
