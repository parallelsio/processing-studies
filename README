Middleman + Bower + p5.js experiment

# download this repository to your machine (laptop)
$ git clone https://github.com/parallelsio/processing-studies.git

$ cd middleman

# install the bundler gem, a version manager for Ruby gems
# This requires ruby. If ruby is not installed, get it using rbenv + HomeBrew (for OSX):
# http://www.rubyinside.com/rbenv-a-simple-new-ruby-version-management-tool-5302.html
$ gem install bundler


# install this project gems, including middleman, a static website generator http://middlemanapp.com/basics/getting-started/
$ bundle install


# install Bower, package manager for front end assets/libraries
# -g is for global, so you only need to do this once to use on other projects (directories)
$ npm install -g bower

# if npm fails, install npm and node with HomeBrew, a package manager for OS X
# http://thechangelog.com/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x/

# download and install this project's front end packages and js libs
$ bower install

$ cd source

# edit your HTML/CSS/JS files at this point

# start local middleman server and browse it at http://localhost:4567
$ middleman

# when ready, generate your final assets with 
$ middleman build
